Type of database using in the project:
MongoDB, PostgreSQL
MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for applications that
require rapid development and deployment. It is schema-less, allowing the storage of various documents, and easily 
scales horizontally to accommodate large data sets. MongoDB is efficient in handling large volumes of data and complex 
queries. However, it offers eventual consistency, which may not be suitable for all applications, and its data 
consistency and memory usage can be challenging. When compared to PostgreSQL, MongoDB is selected for its scalability and
flexibility in handling large, unstructured data sets, aligning with specific application's data management needs.
